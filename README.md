# neanderthal_tract_lengths

- use bedtools to map inferred Neanderthal segments from Sankararaman et al to gene locations
- integrate gene function, recombination and population frequency data to find features affecting Neanderthal introgressed segment lengths
- carry out grid search with DAIM.py to infer selection parameters for each gene
